Worked on prepping MNIST data, coding sigmoid activation function and a class for the FeedForward layer. Trying to develop this using an OOP approach so I can easily extend in the future with other acitvation fns/loss fns/layers (eg convolutional)/etc.

Despite the fact I am comfortable with how the forward pass works, it took longer than expected to implement this in code.

The next step is to develop a network class capable of performing the forward pass. Following this, I will implement the backpropagation algorithm to train the network. I beed to further develop my understanding of backpropagation as I am not confortable with the concept yet. 

Additionally, at some point I should write some unit tests to enforce good coding habits but at the minute conceptual understanding is the priority.
